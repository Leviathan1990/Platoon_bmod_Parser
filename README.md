Designed for the games Plat00n and Haegemonia developed by Digital Reality Kft. 

This version was designed for the game Plat00n, but I'm currently working on the GUI version of the tool, which will also support Haegemonia. After fixing all the existing issues, the project will be ported natively to Linux (Plat00n Modding Tool GUI) using QT Creator.
